Hi, I'm Naveen Kumar Attaluri. I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong focus on defensive strategies and techniques. Passionate about securing systems, I specialize in vulnerability assessments, threat mitigation, and incident response. At the same time, I am continuously exploring offensive security techniques to better understand adversarial tactics and enhance defensive measures. I believe in a proactive approach to cybersecurity and am dedicated to bridging the gap between both sides of the security spectrum.

 ### Projects
 *Tic Tac Tae
  *Tic Tac Toe, also known as "Noughts and Crosses" or "X's and O's," is a classic two-player strategy game. Played on a 3x3 grid, the objective is to be the first player to align three of your marks (X or O) either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Rules:
Players take turns placing their marks in an empty square.
The game ends when one player forms a row of three marks or when the grid is full (resulting in a draw).
The first player typically plays "X," and the second player plays "O."
Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet engaging game that encourages strategic thinking and pattern recognition, making it enjoyable for all ages.
